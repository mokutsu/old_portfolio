    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> I'm a web developer, with 2 years of experience working as a full-stack dev. I've recently forayed into user experience, working with a major retailer for their e-commerce team. Though I love working with UXers, I really miss coding and actually getting to work on the technical issues, and creating these great experiences for end users. </p>

    <h3>Stack</h3>
    <p>As a dev, I've mostly worked on full stack projects in python and javascript. Some of the tools I've worked with include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Python: Django MVT framework, Django REST framework, testing</li>
      <li>Classic JavaScript: ES5 (aka vanilla Javascript, plain JS), jquery</li>
      <li>Modern JavaScript: ES6, NPM, React, ES6, Babel, Webpack, Jest, Enzyme</li>
      <li>Workflow tools: Version control (GIT, github), agile workflow (ok, agile-ish. let's be real here.), backlog management (kanban-style trello, zenhub)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Previously...</h3>
    <p>I've also got around 4 years of experience in engineering consulting under my belt too. In a previous life, I worked as a <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotechnical_engineering'>Geotechnical Engineer</a> <a href='//peo.on.ca/index.php?ci_id=2064&la_id=1'>(EIT)</a>, mostly for mine <a href='//vancouversun.com/technology/tailings+dams+work/10102756/story.html'>tailings</a> projects, with small bits of work on large-scale transportation infrastructure mixed in too. After I got my degree in Geological Engineering, I also did a bit of environmental engineering, mostly relating to site assessment and remediation for urban, contminated (e.g. formerly industrial) sites. </p>


    <h3>Otherwise...</h3>
    <p>Outside of coding, reading about coding, reading about things related to coding like ux and product design, helping people learn to code, etc., I enjoy:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cooking and eating,</li>
      <li>Being outside,</li>
      <li>Board games, and</li>
      <li>creating lists.</li>
    </ul>
