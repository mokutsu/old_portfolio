        <p class='life-story'>
          I am currently a Full Stack Developer at
          G Adventures, here in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I get to work with some really smart people, and ask some really dumb questions, which is always a good time.</p>
        <p class='life-story'>
          I've been a developer for about 1-2 years now, mostly working on full stack projects.
        </p>
        <p class='life-story'>
          I've also got around 4 years of experience in engineering consulting under my belt too.  In a previous life, I worked as a Geotechnical Engineer (EIT), mostly for mine tailings projects (and a bit on transportaion infrastructure too).  After I got my degree in Geological Engineering, I also did a bit of environmental engineering, mostly relating to urban industrial contaminated sites.
</p>

          Outside of coding, I enjoy:
          <ul>
            <li>Tinkering / crafting and making stuff like crotcheting, sewing, cooking, etc.</li>
            <li>Staying active by walking/running, and atively convincing friends to take me hiking with them,</li>
            <li>and practicing the coolest dance moves at zumba</li>
          </ul>
