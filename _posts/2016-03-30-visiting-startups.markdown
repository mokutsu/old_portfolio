<p>Hello again! We visited the IBM office in downtown Toronto, which is home to several start-ups. Below are some quick notes (it’s getting late!):</p>
<ul>
<li>big emphasis on use of analytics and IBM’s Watson analytics in particular</li>
<li>introduction to what is a start-up, how do you get from an initial idea, through validation and into actual production</li>
<li>good introduction to what kinds of challenges people faced when they were starting, their backgrounds, and their current thoughts / work flow processes</li>

<p>One thing that really caught my attention was the potential for machine learning in the classification of historically qualitative things or things that require significant lab data for verification
A couple of the start-ups highlighted their use of how machine learning was integrated into their software. One of these was using signals from one biometric test to predict outcomes of a traditionally more expensive and rigorous test. Another was using this for developing user preference profiles and deliver suggestions.</p>

<p>A quick google seems to indicate that machine learning seems to indicate that much of the use of this technology is for business and market analytics. However, coming from my geotechnical / geological background, I am fascinated by the idea of applying this technology to soil and rock classification.</p>

<p>Overall, soil and rock classification tends to boil down to 4 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a qualitative visual description of the particles making up the earth material and the structure of the earth material itself</li>
<li>field testing data done periodically as drilling or test pitting is done</li>
<li>field testing via continuous profiling with CPTs</li>
<li>lab testing conducted on samples taken intermittently in depth and space</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be interesting to see how machine learning could be applied to formalize the process of soil and rock classification (which could help in QA of logged soils/rocks and help when there is insufficient lab or field data) as well as how it could be integrated with more traditional methods of geostatistics to interpret the overall spatial distribution of these materials.</p>

<p>Upon reflection, I’d assume there is huge potential for this in the field of interpretation of non-intrusive testing results such as in geophysical methods like seismic surveys and resistivity surveying among other methods. Effectively, there seems to be a geological equivalent to a lot of medical testing and it would be interesting to see what kinds of technological cross overs will develop in the next few years.</p>

<p>Anyways at this point, this is just some food for thought, which I’m hoping to chew over some more.</p>
