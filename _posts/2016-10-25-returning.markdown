Hello reader! It’s been a while, hasn’t it?  There’s been a lot going on lately, and writing content for this blog has fallen to the side. Neglected, like a cactus plant a friend might have gifted you a while ago, and you left on the window sill so it could enjoy the summer sun light, but then promptly forgot about because it’s been so good on its own, and are only remembering now that we’re talking about neglected things… *be right back!*

Anyways, getting back on track, I’ll be breaking this up into multiple sections, since there is so much that i want to write, and no one wants to read a long, winding, mess of an article (myself included). Below are some of the proposed topics:

-Life after a coding bootcamp (job hunting, self-directed learning, motivation)

-First job after a boot camp (learning. so much learning.)

-Code Quality and learning (learning. so much learning.)

-Testing (coverage, best practices, unit testing, mutability, front-end testing, TDD)

-Django / Django REST (rails vs django, pythonic vs rubyesque choices)

-React, Redux, ES6 /7 (keeping up, gotchas, motivation)

-Yarn, GraphQL, keeping up with the Joneses (spoiler alert: I tried. I didn’t.)

-Redux Forms / React Select, and NPMs in general (dependencies as a whole maybe?)

-Rebasing and changing the commit history, documentation (are we being honest here?)

-Hot fixes, bugs vs. features (specs in traditional engineering vs. “agile” methods)

-Traditional engineering teams vs product/dev division

-Functional Programming (baby steps)

-Moving, moving on, career finding (opportunities! introspection! yay!)

Let’s see if I can keep up with this, or how far astray I can go. That said, it’s nice to be back, and I hope you find some use from this too.

Cheers,
-m
