Hello reader!

This is yet another selfish post, and is really just a cross between a post and a way to distinguish helpful links from my overflowing book marks.

When I was learning python and django, I went about it a bit circularly, and I had a bit of a time understanding virtualenv and pyenv. Transitioning from Ruby to Python itself has been fairly painless but understanding the environment and tooling has been interesting. Without further ado, below are some of the most helpful references I have come across when learning to build web apps with python.

1. trial and error (without fail, number one)

2. pyenv

3. virtualenv

4. python itself

5. Django

Oh, and did I mention trial and error?
